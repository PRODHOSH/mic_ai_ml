# IMDb Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

**MIC CLUB AI/ML PROJECT - PRODHOSH VS**

A machine learning project that classifies IMDb movie reviews as positive or negative using Logistic Regression for the beginner batch.

## 🎯 Objective

Classify IMDb movie reviews as **'positive'** or **'negative'** using Logistic Regression (beginner batch).

## 📊 Dataset

- Contains **50,000 reviews** labeled as positive or negative
- Binary classification problem
- CSV format with review text and sentiment labels

## 🔧 Approach & Steps

### 1. **Loading Data**
Read the CSV file containing reviews and sentiment labels.

### 2. **Text Preprocessing** 
Use CountVectorizer to convert review text into numeric features.

### 3. **Splitting**
Split data into train and test sets (80/20).

### 4. **Model**
Train Logistic Regression on the vectorized data.

### 5. **Evaluation**
Check accuracy and show a classification report.

## 📈 Results

**Test accuracy achieved: 87%**

## 🛠️ Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Download the dataset CSV and place it in the same folder.
2. Run the Python script

## 💻 Technologies

- **Python 100.0%** - Primary programming language
- **Logistic Regression** - Classification algorithm
- **CountVectorizer** - Text preprocessing and feature extraction
